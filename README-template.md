## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

Box-shadow: to acquire that solid shadow had to do a little research (my personal one was too blurred)
Hover effect: I used effect from my other project.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://cssgenerator.pl/en/box-shadow-generator/) - Great website to practice box-shadow and generate some.
